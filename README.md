This script establishes an SQLite database for an e-commerce platform, creating structured tables for customers, orders, and products. It inserts sample data to ensure meaningful query results, allowing retrieval of customer details, recent orders, and product listings sorted by price. Key queries utilize SQL joins to link customer orders, while subqueries and aggregate functions extract insights like total revenue and the most expensive product. A dedicated view organizes customer order data for streamlined access, while indexes optimize query performance. The final implementation ensures efficient database operations, allowing for insightful data exploration and improved decision-making.
